                "Take naps every day.",
                "You get one family, so stick with them. But it depends if these hardships are financial or emotional or other types. Stick it out. Some days are worse than others, and you have to be ok with that. The night is darkest before dawn.",
                "I try to take the time to look at and appreciate the smaller things that make this life beautiful. When I do that, time slows.",

                "Laughter keeps you healthy. You can survive by seeing the humor in everything. Thumb your nose at sadness; turn the tables on tragedy. You can't laugh and be angry, you can't laugh and feel sad, you can't laugh and feel envious.",
                "Look inside your soul and find your tools. We all have tools and have to live with the help of them. I have two tools: my words and my images.
